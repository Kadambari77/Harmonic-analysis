# Harmonic-analysis
# Harmonic Analysis Tool

This project provides a tool to perform **harmonic analysis on AC signals**. It calculates the **Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** and displays individual harmonic components using **Fourier analysis**. 

## **Features**
- **Fourier Analysis:** Extracts individual harmonics from AC signals.
- **THD Calculation:** Computes Total Harmonic Distortion.
- **Harmonic Plot:** Visualizes the magnitude of each harmonic component.
- **Sample Signals:** Includes pre-loaded signals for testing purposes.
